## 001 // healthy

and it’s not healthy but i don’t wanna be
cause without u i don’t even feel like me
it’s not healthy
i’m not healthy 

and it’s not healthy but i don’t wanna be 
cause without u i just feel like less of me
and it’s not healthy 
god help me

it’s like i’m waiting for my next fix
i fill the void with my bag of tricks
drifting, stagnant, so full of shit
soon i’ll be floating down the Styx

if the river’s poisoned the fault is mine
i burst the banks inside my mind
i could’ve drowned if u weren’t around
still can’t find that solid ground

(chorus repeats)

philosophical divide feeling like a trench
do i like who i’ve become in your absence
looking in your eyes i know i don’t make sense
shiver up my spine, it’s is getting too intense 

maybe i just need some self respect 
maybe it’s time that i repent

get out of my mind 
you’ve taken all my time

get out of my mind
you’ve take up too much time

get out of my head
i’ve wasted my whole life

get out of my mind

and i’m not healthy
i kinda need to be
it’s not your fault at all
i know what’s wrong with me

fixing it could be so easy
