## 003 // without a sound


spirals falling falling 

twirling spirals falling
drown in anguish
done with losing 
everything important

gotta find my find my find 
why can’t i find my focus
fractalized, my crystal eyes
the tears already frozen

without a sound 
too in my head now
my thoughts corralled
by screams i can’t shout

my vision cracks
like the mirror i broke
can’t look at myself 
while i’m ending it all

without a sound
without a sound
without a sound
i’m too in my head now

without a sound
without a sound
without a sound
without a sound


walk in your room
the light dissipates.
why couldn’t you wait?
why couldn’t you wait.
